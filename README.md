^^^ B. Fisher ^^^

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Version 13_ - Revised CSS. Added marble background with opacity on the squares. << B. Fisher

v13.1 - Added and corrected En Passant << J-M Glenn

v13.3 - Removed the Player object from the Game object. Creating a Player sets up its pieces.
			Set Players as a global var. Turn changes reverses the Players array. << B. Fisher

v13.2 - Fixed En Passant and implemented enPassant() function << J-M Glenn
 
v13.4 - En Passant capture is fully functional including clearing the pawns EP variables at the end
			of the current player's turn. << B. Fisher 2/28 2100

v13.5 - check function passed initial testing. Captured pieces need to be removed from Player pieces array << B. Fisher 3/1 0330

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Version 14_
v14.3 - Moved capture functionality to the Player object. Pieces are now removed from the array on capture.
			Check function is working. Added Checkmate (comments only) and Stalemate function (untested). << B. Fisher 3/03 2200

v14.4 - Modified check function to return checking pieces. << B. Fisher 3/04 0300

v14.5 - Added skipKing option to the check function to prevent recursion over the Legal function.
			Legal is removing threatened squares from the kings legal moves. Still doesn't recognize protected pieces.
			Started adding movePiece functionality into the Piece.move() function. << B. Fisher 3/04 1930

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Version 15_ - Removed the movePiece function. All piece movement is now handled by the individual piece objects
			and the Piece class. Revamped the Legality function to handle pawn capture and en passant legality.
			also disabled piece drag and drop due to issues with turn changes. << B. Fisher 3/05 2310

v15.1 - Added pawn promotion << B. Fisher 3/06 0230

v15.2 - Corrected issue with piece removal from pieces array on capture << B. Fisher 3/06 0430

v15.3 - Added pinning check to Piece._move function. Detaches the piece and runs check before moving the piece.
			Still doesn't work fully, as the piece should still be able to move within the pinning vector << B. Fisher 3/07 2100

v15.4 - Resolved pinned against king issues except when the pinning piece captures the pinner << B. Fisher 3/07 2115

v15.5 - Still working on pinned against king issues. Pinning piece can move if not resulting in check. King in check isn't able to move
			except to take the checking piece due to recursion issues with Legal and check functions. << B. Fisher 3/10 0500

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Resolved check issues. Corrected opponent pawn capture and move when requesting check function. Also corrected opponent king moves when 
         calling check function. << B. Fisher 3/14 2200

           << B. Fisher 3/21
